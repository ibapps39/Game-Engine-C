# My Game Engine <i>written in C</i>

## Who am I?
My name is Ian Brown. I am a Software Engineer, Game Developer, and Game Designer. I recived a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the Colorado State University (2021). I also have a Bachelors of the Arts in Economics from the University of Colorado (2018).

Since graduating I have worked as a SWE for several contractors and comapnies. It was through these experiences that I honed my skills but learned that I wasn't going to be satisfied with what I was doing. While I am continuing to grow and develop my goals and skills, I am looking to use this project to help me get a start in the world of game development. 

## What is this?
This is my first attempt at creating my very own game engine. I am currently working on this project as a hobby and portfolio project. 

## What is my goal?
I am hoping to use this project to learn more about game development and to get a better understanding of how to create a game engine and games overall. 

I want to create an engine that both brings the power and speed of C, while also being easy to use and understand. Games are an art, an experience, and I want to make both of those dynamics stand out to the fullest.

## Why C
C is a great language to use for game development. It is a great language to use for programming, and it is a great language to use for creating games. It is also one of my favorite languages to use. I appericiate the power and speed of C, all whil being easy to use and understand.

## Stages
- State Manager
- Graphic Init.
- Entity
- Physics
- Logic
- Input
- Sound
## Goals
- Create as much of the game engine in the C programming language and it's most recent standard <i> C17 - ISO/IEC 9899:2018</i>
- Simple Physics
- Save Game
- Load Game
- Load Map
- OpenGL ES 3 (or later) for rendering
- Rendering
- Be done with it before the end of May 2022
- Export/Import Project
- Click to compile
- Character movement
- Character animation
- Get a job!
- Game playable on Windows, Mac, Linux

## Todo
- [X] Do initial setup
- [X] Create README.md
- [ ] Create a state manager
- [ ] Create a graphic init.
- [ ] Create an entity
